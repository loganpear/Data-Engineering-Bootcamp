# Data Engineering Bootcamp Notes and Labs

Welcome to my Data Engineering Bootcamp repository! This repository contains my notes from lectures and code from labs led by Zach Wilson as part of his free Data Engineering Bootcamp.  

## About This Repository
I'm taking this course to deepen my understanding of data engineering concepts and gain hands-on experience with practical tools and techniques. This bootcamp helps me build on the technical skills I’ve already learned and ensures that I’m well-prepared for my first professional data engineering role.

### What You'll Find Here:
- **Lecture Notes:** Key takeaways and concepts from each lecture.
- **Lab Code:** Practical exercises and solutions for the labs, applying real-world data engineering techniques.
